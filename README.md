the file exact_mean calculates the mean scores for two cases deterministically. However, it gets really tedious 
to calculate the standard deviation and the conditional probability.
to get the out put of the calculation please change the cursor pointer ( in the command shell) to the CardGame folder 
and then run the following command to printout the results:
python exact_mean.py
